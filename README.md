# FlexDiffADC_ESP32_Example
This Flex Differential ADC example code is meant to work with an ESP32 based Arduino because it uses fast pin setting functions (faster than digitalwrite) to help get the max sample rate  from the ADC. See the other Flex Differential ADC example code sketch that is configured to work with any arduino board
